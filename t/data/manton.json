				"content_html": "<p>There was a session at IndieWebCamp Austin about broken links and archiving web sites. As part of the discussion, <a href=\"http://tantek.com/\">Tantek</a> mentioned how he saves all his blog posts and tweets to the Internet Archive as part of his posting workflow. I&rsquo;ve just added a setting like that to Micro.blog under Posts ‚Üí Design:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://www.manton.org/uploads/2019/b80d126bc8.png\" alt=\"Checkbox screenshot\" border=\"0\" width=\"319\" height=\"48\" style=\"width: 319px;\" /></p>\n\n<p>This is off by default for now, but if you enable it, any new posts will be saved to the Internet Archive automatically. It waits about 5 minutes before saving them just in case you have any last-minute edits.</p>\n\n<p>I still want to do more with archiving. As amazing as the Internet Archive is, I don&rsquo;t think we should count on it to have a complete archive of the web. But this is a simple feature you can enable in your blog if it&rsquo;s hosted on Micro.blog, and we can expand it based on feedback. (For example, maybe archiving pages you link to as well.)</p>\n",

As I did after <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2017/12/12/indiewebcamp-austin-wrapup.html\">the 1st IndieWebCamp Austin</a>, I&rsquo;m going to summarize some of what I took away from the event.</p>\n\n<p>Saturday morning started with my quick introduction to the IndieWeb, some thoughts from the perspective of Micro.blog, and then laying out the schedule for IndieWebCamp. Next up, Aaron Parecki gave a keynote on the state of social readers: how we can use apps to both read other people&rsquo;s blogs and also reply to posts.</p>\n\n<p>There was a time for personal site demos, where any attendee could show their web site and talk a little about what they&rsquo;ve done with it recently or what improvements they might want to make. We then had a planning session, proposing ideas for sessions to organize the schedule for the afternoon. This is the un-conference style that I&rsquo;m still getting used to, but which is really effective at shaping the conference for what attendees are actually interested in.</p>\n\n<p>For the Sunday hack day, I focused on 2 things: experimenting with a Micro.blog export for the Blog Archive Format that <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2017/11/24/blog-archive-format.html\">I proposed here</a>, and implementing the Microsub API in Micro.blog as a server. Along the way I also improved Micro.blog&rsquo;s support for replies via Micropub.</p>\n\n<p>Having everyone in the same room is a great chance to bounce ideas off one another or find and fix bugs. <a href=\"http://micro.corntoole.com/\">Cornelius Toole</a> was also working on a script to create archive files, so we were able to work together and brainstorm on whether this could be used to transfer podcasts between providers. <a href=\"https://aaronparecki.com/\">Aaron Parecki</a> and I talked through a couple aspects of the Microsub and Micropub APIs that needed tweaking.</p>\n\n<p>I&rsquo;ll have more to share about the Blog Archive Format when it&rsquo;s live on Micro.blog. I&rsquo;ve been testing it this morning with a fix that wasn&rsquo;t ready in time for my IndeWebCamp demo.</p>\n\n<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in attending an IndieWebCamp, <a href=\"https://2019.indieweb.org/\">there will be several more this year</a> at cities from New Haven to Berlin, including IndieWeb Summit in Portland in June. I&rsquo;m always inspired to see what people are working on, and it usually leads to new features in Micro.blog as well. Thanks again to everyone who made it to IndieWebCamp Austin!</p>\n",

				"title": "Marzipan 2021",
				"content_html": "<p>On <a href=\"https://coreint.org/361\">the latest Core Intuition</a> we covered <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-02-20/apple-is-said-to-target-combining-iphone-ipad-mac-apps-by-2021\">this Bloomberg article from Mark Gurman</a> about Marzipan. Many bloggers have written about it this week, skeptical that Marzipan will ever produce great Mac apps, but maybe we&rsquo;re not giving enough credit to Apple&rsquo;s strategy. Let&rsquo;s start with this part of the article:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>By 2021, developers will be able to merge iPhone, iPad, and Mac applications into one app or what is known as a ‚Äúsingle binary.‚Äù This means developers won‚Äôt have to submit their work to different Apple App Stores, allowing iOS apps to be downloaded directly from Mac computers &ndash; effectively combining the stores.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Marzipan is a multi-year effort. It exists today mostly as a prototype, not meant for developers, with obvious limitations such as iOS-like controls and sheets poking through in the UI. The next phase will be much more mature. And then by 2021 we&rsquo;ll have more polish and a consistent App Store submission experience across platforms.</p>\n\n<p>What we can&rsquo;t predict yet is how users will react to third-party apps. An assumption in the Mac developer community is that native, all-AppKit macOS apps will always be better than iOS apps ported with Marzipan. I believe that too. Apps originally designed for the Mac will have more thought put to the windows, controls, menus ‚Äî¬†everything that makes an app Mac-like.</p>\n\n<p>But familiarity might be an advantage. What if users end up <em>preferring</em> Marzipan apps simply because they want their apps to work exactly the same across multiple platforms? What if Marzipan is more than &ldquo;good enough&rdquo;, but actually exactly what users are looking for, seeing their favorite iOS apps on macOS for the first time? (Again, not the Marzipan of today, which isn&rsquo;t ready, but the Marzipan of a couple years from now.)</p>\n\n<p>With a unified App Store in 2021, I think it&rsquo;s likely that Apple will encourage universal apps that have a single price for running across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. While this seems unfair by traditional Mac development standards ‚Äî when developing for AppKit could be a completely different codebase and depth of features, justifying a separate purchase¬†‚Äî for Marzipan it seems reasonable to pay once and get the app everywhere.</p>\n\n<p>Marzipan looks like a very different transition than what we went through with Carbon and Cocoa. <a href=\"https://www.manton.org/2003/08/05/carbon-and-cocoa.html\">As I blogged about in 2003</a>, you could start using Cocoa windows and controls directly in a Carbon app. For Marzipan, it doesn&rsquo;t appear that you can mix AppKit into a UIKit app. If this holds true, it will split Mac development into 2 paths.</p>\n\n<p>I plan to keep Micro.blog using AppKit, for now. But I wouldn&rsquo;t bet against Marzipan, and I&rsquo;ll be looking for what Apple says at WWDC. Not what they say about Marzipan itself, but about AppKit. If the usual &ldquo;What&rsquo;s New in Cocoa&rdquo; session at WWDC is missing or filled with very minor tweaks to AppKit, the writing will be on the wall that UIKit is where we should put all our attention, even on the Mac.</p>\n",

As I was talking about with Daniel on <a href=\"https://coreint.org/361\">the latest Core Intuition</a>, because the 2nd day of IndieWebCamp is a hack day, it&rsquo;s also a great environment to work on something you&rsquo;ve had trouble finishing‚Ä¶ or starting!
