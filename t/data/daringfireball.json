[&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>Trump’s enthusiastic assurance that Alabama would get top-flight\nhelp contrasts sharply with his barbed rhetoric following horrific\nwildfires in California and Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, when\nhe repeatedly threatened to cut off federal aid and picked fights\nwith local politicians, in one instance calling the mayor of San\nJuan “totally incompetent.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The difference between Alabama and Puerto Rico and California, the\npresident’s critics say, is obvious.</p>\n\n<p>“The president really treats differently those people who have\nsupported him in the past and those people who haven’t,” Brian\nOtt, a rhetoric professor at Texas Tech University, told The\nWashington Post. “Not all lives are equal in the eyes of the\npresident. … The lives of red states matter, and the lives of blue\nstates don’t.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s one outrage after another with this administration, I know.

All day long, Trump retweets claims\nmade on the network; his press secretary, Sarah Sanders, has\nlargely stopped holding press conferences, but she has made some\nthirty appearances on such shows as “Fox &amp; Friends” and “Hannity.”\nTrump, Hemmer says, has “almost become a programmer.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I still think Trump needs Fox News more than Fox News needs Trump, but ultimately Fox News is at the mercy of its audience.

Today, I&#8217;m going to\ndetail a special tool I built, called Marzipanify, to get started\nwith UIKit on the Mac early, and start the initial bringup of your\niOS app on macOS. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/steventroughtonsmith/marzipanify\">Marzipanify</a> is a tool I created to statically convert an iOS\napp built for the iOS Simulator to macOS. It means you can\ncontinue working on and building your existing iOS app from its\nexisting project, using the existing iOS SDK, and just run the\ntool against the Simulator build to create a functioning Mac app.\nAs a bonus, Marzipanify will yell at you when you&#8217;re linking\nagainst a framework or library that doesn&#8217;t currently exist in the\niOSMac runtime. It trivializes the process so you can focus on\nadapting your app rather than managing a build environment.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>What a crazy project.

The lesson some people are going to take from this is that enabling two-factor authentication is for suckers.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Update:</strong> A friend messaged me: &#8220;My takeaway from <a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2012/08/apple-amazon-mat-honan-hacking/\">the Mat Honan debacle</a> was that 2FA that involves SMS or a phone number is absolutely for suckers and/or chumps. (The 2FA implementation in 1Password, using the same TOTP protocol as Google Authenticator or Authy, is glorious.)&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a good point, and I agree. I spent an afternoon last year decoupling my phone as second factor from every account I could. But it&#8217;s depressing how many services &#8212; like my bank &#8212; only support SMS as a second factor.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.fastcompany.com/90314763/now-facebook-is-allowing-anyone-to-look-you-up-using-your-security-phone-number\">fastcompany.com/90314763/now-facebook-is-allowing-anyone-to…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

The\nGalaxy S10 is distinctly Samsung &#8212; it’s not a copy of the iPhone\nor any other device you can buy. In fact, it almost feels like the\nopposite of the iPhone: if you’ve been frustrated with Apple’s\nrecent devices for lacking headphone jacks, adding notches, or\nremoving fingerprint scanners, Samsung is here for you with a\nheadphone jack, a fingerprint scanner, and a notchless screen\ndesign (that has some other compromises). It feels a bit like the\nS10 is the anti-iPhone.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the in-display ultrasonic fingerprint sensor:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Even then, I often had to try more than once before the S10 would\nunlock. I’d just rather have a Face ID system that requires less\nwork to use, or at the very least, an old-school fingerprint\nscanner on the back of the phone. The S10 does have a face unlock\nfeature, but it’s just using the camera to look for your face and\ncompare it to a previous image &#8212; there’s no 3D mapping or\nanything. I was actually able to unlock the S10 with a video of my\nface played on another phone. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>But here’s my feedback to Samsung: go copy Apple’s Face ID system.\nIt’s far easier and more reliable to use than the S10’s\nnifty-looking but ultimately disappointing in-screen fingerprint\nscanner.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245446/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus-android-phone-review-price-specs-features\">theverge.com/2019/3/1/18245446/samsung-galaxy-s10-plus…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

Face ID\nworks on the first try most of the time, but even without Require\nAttention it fails to recognize me more often than Touch ID does.\nAnd, perhaps due to an iOS change, even when it seems like it did\nrecognize me, I need to type my passcode multiple times per day.\nWhen the phone is in my pocket, Face ID feels slower than even the\niPhone SE’s Touch ID. Even with first-generation Touch ID, I could\nput my finger on the sensor and have the phone unlock while I was\nraising it to my face. With Face ID, even with Raise to Wake, I\nstill have to wait until the phone is in front of me and then\nswipe up. Face ID also fails in some circumstances where Touch ID\nworked, such as lying sideways on a pillow in bed or wearing ski\ngoogles. However, Face ID also has advantages. It works with\ngloves on, with wet fingers, and with dry/cracked skin. It’s more\nconvenient when the phone is in a dock or car mount where it would\nbe hard to get my hand under it to put my thumb on the sensor.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a great one-paragraph summary of the pros and cons of Face ID vs Touch ID. For me it&#8217;s a clear win for Face ID even though I run into the same cons as Tsai.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The display is amazing. I actually think it looks better than the\nOLED screen on the iPhone XS. Text on OLED screens looks a bit\nfunny to me, especially when scrolling. There’s a weird color\neffect that kind of reminds me of Microsoft’s ClearType.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been saying the same thing, including on <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/2019/01/23/ep-241\">a recent episode of my podcast talking to Joanna Stern</a>, who just bought herself a XR for her own use. For using the iOS interface &#8212; Safari, Twitter, Mail, Messages &#8212; I really do think I prefer a great LCD to an OLED display.

Someone is stabbing him,\ndozens of times, while he screams and begs for his life. Chloe’s\njob is to tell the room whether this post should be removed. She\nknows that section 13 of the Facebook community standards\nprohibits videos that depict the murder of one or more people.\nWhen Chloe explains this to the class, she hears her voice\nshaking.</p>\n\n<p>Returning to her seat, Chloe feels an overpowering urge to sob.\nAnother trainee has gone up to review the next post, but Chloe\ncannot concentrate. She leaves the room, and begins to cry so hard\nthat she has trouble breathing.</p>\n\n<p>No one tries to comfort her. This is the job she was hired to do.\nAnd for the 1,000 people like Chloe moderating content for\nFacebook at the Phoenix site, and for 15,000 content reviewers\naround the world, today is just another day at the office.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Just a stunning piece of writing and reporting. Kudos to Newton and The Verge for this piece.</p>\n\n<p>I particularly enjoyed this tidbit, where Facebook&#8217;s own moderators are bitten by an algorithmic (as opposed to chronological) feed:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The fourth source is perhaps the most problematic: Facebook’s own\ninternal tools for distributing information. While official policy\nchanges typically arrive every other Wednesday, incremental\nguidance about developing issues is distributed on a near-daily\nbasis. Often, this guidance is posted to Workplace, the enterprise\nversion of Facebook that the company introduced in 2016. Like\nFacebook itself, Workplace has an algorithmic News Feed that\ndisplays posts based on engagement. During a breaking news event,\nsuch as a mass shooting, managers will often post conflicting\ninformation about how to moderate individual pieces of content,\nwhich then appear out of chronological order on Workplace. Six\ncurrent and former employees told me that they had made moderation\nmistakes based on seeing an outdated post at the top of their\nfeed. At times, it feels as if Facebook’s own product is working\nagainst them. The irony is not lost on the moderators.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p>The bottom line: If this is what it takes to moderate Facebook, it&#8217;s an indictment of the basic concept of Facebook itself. In theory it sounds like a noble idea to let everyone in the world post whatever they want and have it be connected and amplified to like-minded individuals.</p>\n\n<p>In practice, it&#8217;s a disaster.</p>\n\n<p>The problem isn&#8217;t the &#8220;everyone can post whatever they want&#8221; &#8212; that&#8217;s the nature of the internet, and I truly believe it has democratized communication in a good way. The disastrous part is the &#8220;be connected and amplified to like-minded individuals&#8221;. That&#8217;s the difference between Facebook (and to some degree, YouTube and Twitter) and things like plain old web forums. Facebook is full of shit about most of what they actually do, but one part of their self description that is true is that they really do connect people. The problem is that some people shouldn&#8217;t be connected, and some messages should not be amplified.</p>\n\n<p>There is something fundamentally wrong with a platform that &#8212; while operating exactly as designed &#8212; requires thousands of employees to crush their own souls.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

The software side of\nApple’s user interfaces &#8212; especially on iOS, which isn’t as\nhardened by long tradition as on the Mac &#8212; has become steadily\nmore cryptic under Ive’s control. Some of this is due to Apple’s\nneed to squeeze more functionality into the OS, but Ive hasn’t\nbeen up to the task of melding the new functions into the UI in a\nconsistent and discoverable way.</p>\n\n<p>To me, Ahrendts’s five years in charge of Retail has been similar\nto Ive’s time as Chief Design Officer. The Apple Stores look\nbetter than ever, but they don’t work as well as they used to. No\none I know looks forward to going to an Apple Store, even when\nit’s for the fun task of buying a new toy. No doubt a lot of this\nis due to Apple’s success and the mobs of people milling about,\nbut Ahrendts didn’t solve the problem of efficiently handling the\nincreased customer load.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I think the problem with the Apple Store shopping experience is primarily that, in the iPhone era, Apple&#8217;s popularity has increased far more than they&#8217;ve increased their retail footprint. Demand has outstripped supply.</p>\n\n<p>But the comparison to Ive taking responsibility for software design is interesting, too, because I think he&#8217;s also taken more responsibility for the design of the stores. When they say he&#8217;s head of design, they mean he&#8217;s head of <em>all</em> design.

No, the\nSocialists have not taken over America. The biggest opponent to\nAmazon HQ2 in NYC was not from the new Congressional class, all\nthey did was make some noise, and little to do with what actually\nmattered. It was not, to the chagrin of Fox News, AOC or\nElizabeth Warren, or anyone else in Congress. All of the\nincentives for this were State + City, not Federal. Congress\n<em>literally</em> had no say on this.</p>\n\n<p><em>Spoiler alert:</em> It was Jeff Bezos.

In those videos, members of what Watson\ncalled a “soft-core pedophilia ring” made sexualized comments\nabout the girls tagged with timestamps identifying moments in the\nvideos when the kids were in certain poses.

Executives have discussed borrowing visual\ncues from Apple’s fitness-tracking app, where “rings” close as\nusers hit daily exercise targets, and sending users notifications\nabout their spending habits. There also could be notifications\nbased on analysis of cardholders’ spending patterns, alerting them\nfor example if they paid more than usual for groceries one week.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>My American Express card is incredibly well-integrated with my phone already.</p>\n\n<p>My big question is what the interest rates are going to be. Credit cards have turned into a dirty business where people who carry a balance pay <a href=\"https://www.valuepenguin.com/average-credit-card-interest-rates\">exorbitant interest rates</a>, even if they&#8217;ve never missed a payment. And the higher the interest rates, the harder it is to pay off the balance. Is that where Apple wants Services revenue growth to come from?

Developers will still need to submit separate versions\nof the app to Apple’s iOS and Mac App Stores, but the new kit will\nmean they don’t have to write the underlying software code twice,\nsaid the people familiar with the plan.</p>\n\n<p>In 2020, Apple plans to expand the kit so iPhone applications can\nbe converted into Mac apps in the same way. Apple engineers have\nfound this challenging because iPhone screens are so much smaller\nthan Mac computer displays.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>In some ways this makes sense &#8212; iPad apps are closer in scope to Mac apps. But for iPhone apps that don&#8217;t have iPad counterparts, why would developers target the Mac if they haven&#8217;t even bothered with iPad yet? And <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stroughtonsmith/status/1098279060357218306\">as Steven Troughton-Smith observed</a>, in some ways the Mac is better-suited to iPhone apps than iPad is, because you can just run the app in a small window on the Mac, whereas iPad apps need to be full-screen, which leads iPhone-only apps running on iPad to look dreadful.</p>\n\n<p>The only upside I can see to this entire endeavor is that some media consumption apps (Netflix, HBO, Hulu) might come to the Mac and be better than what we have now (using their websites, which have no offline access). Anything else I dread. I honestly can&#8217;t think of one productivity app on iPad where I&#8217;ve ever thought I&#8217;d like to use that app on the Mac. The best iPad productivity apps I know of &#8212; <a href=\"https://culturedcode.com/\">Things</a>, <a href=\"https://www.omnigroup.com/\">Omni&#8217;s apps</a>, <a href=\"https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/\">Tweetbot</a> &#8212; already have real Mac app counterparts.</p>\n\n<p>Tucked away as the final sentence in the report:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The company has also internally weighed previewing a new version\nof the high-end Mac Pro, according to people familiar with the\ndeliberations.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Given that rumors suggest <a href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/johnpaczkowski/apple-event-march-2019-news\">a late March event</a> focused on subscription services (news and original video content), I would say WWDC <em>has</em> to be the unveiling of the new Mac Pros. Even if they don&#8217;t announce a ship date I&#8217;d be shocked if they don&#8217;t show it &#8212; <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2017/04/the_mac_pro_lives\">they started working on it two years ago</a>.</p>\n\n<p><small>* Bloomberg, of course, is the publication that published &#8220;<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/bloomberg_the_big_hack\">The Big Hack</a>&#8221; in October &#8212; a sensational story alleging that data centers of Apple, Amazon, and dozens of other companies were compromised by China&#8217;s intelligence services. The story presented no confirmable evidence at all, was <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2018/10/what-businessweek-got-wrong-about-apple/\">vehemently denied</a> by <a href=\"https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/setting-the-record-straight-on-bloomberg-businessweeks-erroneous-article/\">all companies</a> involved, <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/erik-wemple/wp/2018/10/22/your-move-bloomberg/?utm_term=.30e1ef835198\">has not been confirmed by a single other publication</a> (despite much effort to do so), and has been <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2018/10/09/big-hack-doubts\">largely discredited by one of Bloomberg&#8217;s own sources</a>. By all appearances &#8220;The Big Hack&#8221; was complete bullshit. Yet Bloomberg has issued no correction or retraction, and seemingly hopes we&#8217;ll all just forget about it. I say we do not just forget about it.

         "content_html" : "\n<p>Samsung introduced five new phones today <a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ISjiJQGJ72o\">at a big show</a> at the Bill Graham Civic Auditorium in San Francisco: the gimmicky Galaxy Fold, the Galaxy S10 (6.1&#34;), S10 Plus (6.4&#34;), S10E (5.8&#34;), and S10 5G (a whopping 6.7&#34;). Some quick thoughts:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>The Galaxy Fold looks like a prototype, <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2019/02/20/samsung-galaxy-fold\">not a shipping product</a>. I think flexible, foldable displays have a good future, but this isn&#8217;t it.</p></li>\n<li><p>The S10 5G, likewise, seems not ready for prime time. Which makes sense, because 5G networks aren&#8217;t really a thing yet. I know I&#8217;m less enamored with big-ass phones than many people, but a 6.7-inch display just seems ridiculous. What&#8217;s the pitch here? Get yourself a too-big phone for a network that doesn&#8217;t yet exist?</p></li>\n<li><p>I know a lot of people who wish Apple would make a smaller flagship than the 5.8-inch iPhone XS, but at least the XS is a full-fledged peer spec-wise to the larger XS Max. Samsung&#8217;s 5.8-inch S10E is more like the iPhone XR, with a starting price of $750 and quite a few technical compromises: fewer cameras and a fingerprint sensor in the side button rather than embedded in the display like on the bigger S10 and S10 Plus.</p></li>\n<li><p>Speaking of that fingerprint sensor, Samsung is sticking to its guns on a couple of fronts: fingerprints instead of facial recognition, and good old-fashioned headphone jacks on every model. And while they didn’t spend much time showing the system software, it looked to me like their interaction model is still home button-based, rather than gesture-based.  (Apparently Samsung’s new One UI <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18229339/samsung-one-ui-update-android-9-pie-galaxy-s10-plus-s10e\">allows you to replace the standard navigation buttons with gestures</a> as an option.) There’s a definite philosophical split from Apple here. I think Apple made the right decision by making a clean break with the iPhone X experience, but <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/11/iphone_xr_theory\">I remain convinced</a> that at least some segment of the iPhone user base is reluctant to upgrade into the new no-home-button / no-headphone-jack / Face-ID-instead-of-Touch-ID world of the iPhone X-class phones. Familiarity has a strong appeal, but stick with it too long and you risk stagnation.</p>\n\n<p>(I also think part of this is technical, not philosophical. A big reason why Samsung is sticking with fingerprints rather than facial recognition is that I don&#8217;t think they have the software chops to do facial recognition well &#8212; reliable, quickly, securely. If they could do a Face ID copycat I think they would. Also: patents.)</p></li>\n<li><p>The hole-punch design for the front-facing cameras looks better than a notch. But part of what makes this possible  is that the S10 phones only have cameras on the front — the iPhone X/XS/XR notch houses an entire sensor array that makes Face ID possible.</p></li>\n<li><p>Samsung is sticking with the dedicated hardware button for Bixby. This is one of the dumbest ideas in the industry — although with the S10 you can finally <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18233819/samsung-galaxy-s10-bixby-button-remap-reassign\">reassign the button to launch something else</a>, like, say, the Camera app.</p></li>\n<li><p>The S10 sides are made from aluminum, but they’re all highly polished, so in marketing photos at least, they look a lot like the stainless steel of the iPhone XS and XS Max.</p></li>\n<li><p>I’m not sure about the S10E, but the bigger S10 models not only support wireless charging for input, but they also can serve as charging pads for other devices, like wireless headphones, a Samsung watch, or even another phone. That sounds crazy at first, but it fits with my theory that phones are the  primary computing devices for a growing number of people. Used to be you’d plan on charging your phone from your laptop midday; today it makes sense in the same way to be able to charge your headphone case or watch from your phone.</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://www.engadget.com/2019/02/20/samsung-galaxy-buds-announced-true-wireless-earbuds/\">Samsung’s $130 wireless earbuds</a> don’t look anything at all like AirPods. The case is smaller but pretty AirPod-like, and the pairing experience is pretty much the same: open the case next to the device and you get a little window picturing the earbuds and case and their respective battery levels. The biggest difference from AirPods: pre-order an S10 or S10 Plus before March 7 and Samsung will give you a pair for free.</p></li>\n<li><p>Samsung introduced two new watches: a big clunky round one called the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18233750/samsung-galaxy-active-smart-watch-photo-video-hands-on-price-specs\">Galaxy Watch Active</a> and a Fitbit-esque bracelet-y looking watch <a href=\"https://news.samsung.com/us/samsung-wearable-galaxy-watch-active-galaxy-fit-galaxy-buds-unpacked-2019/\">called the Galaxy Fit</a> (not to be confused with <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/galaxyace/fit_overview.html\">this crappy old phone</a> they also call the Galaxy Fit). I can’t say I care about either of these at all. The new S10 phones seem like interesting competition to Apple, but these watches don’t.</p></li>\n<li><p>They have a new tablet — <a href=\"https://www.samsung.com/global/galaxy/galaxy-tab-s5e/?cid=afl-ecomm-cjn-cha-092118-52057&amp;cjevent=2b47c88d356c11e981b0003f0a240610\">the Galaxy S5e</a> — that looks shamelessly like an iPad Pro. Not sure anyone cares about it, though, including Samsung — it didn’t even get any stage time.</p></li>\n<li><p>Why the hell does Samsung brand all these things “Galaxy” anyway? Why not just the Samsung S10, Samsung Watch Active, Samsung Fit, Samsung Buds, etc? I guess I can see why they stick with “Galaxy” for the phones, but when introducing new products like wireless earbuds, why?</p></li>\n<li><p><a href=\"https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ISjiJQGJ72o\">The event itself</a> featured some interesting staging. The display wrapped around to include the ceiling and the floor of the stage itself. I think you have to watch a bit of the video of the event to get it. Technically impressive, and very flashy in a way that feels appropriate for Samsung.</p></li>\n<li><p>Two interesting partnerships on software. First, they’re partnering with Adobe for a bespoke “Galaxy” edition of <a href=\"https://www.adobe.com/products/premiere-rush.html\">Premiere Rush</a>, Adobe’s new prosumer video editing app. It’s coming “later this year”, so who knows when it’ll actually ship. I assumed at first it was going to be free for S10 users, but now that I&#8217;ve watched the video again they don&#8217;t say that. (Premiere Rush is normally $10/month, and today the only mobile version is for iOS.) I don’t know how many serious content creators want to or need to edit video directly on their phones, but I’m sure that number is growing. I repeat myself, I know, but phones are taking over more and more tasks that used to require laptops. Having just one pocket-sized device that serves as both your 4K camera and your editing workstation is just amazing. Ten years ago, the then-current iPhone 3G didn’t even shoot video.</p>\n\n<p>Second, Samsung has built Instagram into the system Camera app as its own shooting mode. This seems inexplicable to me. The world is growing ever more wary of the privacy invasiveness of Facebook, and Samsung decides 2019 is the right time to bake Facebook’s Instagram right into the system Camera app? Who thinks using the Instagram app is inconvenient? At best this needlessly complicates the Camera app. </p></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n    "

Samsung is planning to launch the Galaxy Fold on April\n26th, starting at $1,980. There will be both an LTE and 5G version\nof the Galaxy Fold, and Samsung is even planning on launching the\ndevice in Europe on May 3rd, starting at 2,000 euros.</p>\n\n<p>Samsung is using a new 7.3-inch Infinity Flex Display that allows\nthe phone itself to have a tablet-sized screen that can be folded\nto fit into a pocket. The main display is QXGA+ resolution\n(4.2:3), and when it’s folded, a smaller 4.6-inch HD+ (12:9)\ndisplay is used for the phone mode.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I remember when I got a hard time <a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2017/07/03/kuo-iphone-2017-touch-id\">for suggesting it would be a good thing</a> for an iPhone model to start at $1,500. A starting price of $1,980 is eye catching, for sure, but as I&#8217;ve been arguing for years, we accept the fact that pro laptops costs $2,000 or more, so why not $2,000 phones, when for so many people, the phone is by far their most-used and most important computing device? (Not to mention their primary camera.)</p>\n\n<p>But I look at the Galaxy Fold and I still see a prototype. It looks terrible when folded &#8212; a thick device with a tiny display with huge forehead and chin. Clearly the two modes are not equals &#8212; the primary mode is open, and folded is an afterthought. And even in tablet mode, there&#8217;s a weird off-center notch in the corner. It just seems clunky.</p>\n\n<p style=\"padding-top: 1.5em;\"><em>Link: <strong><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/20/18231249/samsung-galaxy-fold-folding-phone-features-screen-photos-size-announcement\">theverge.com/2019/2/20/18231249/samsung-galaxy-fold-folding…</a></strong></em></p>\n"

         "content_html" : "\n<p>At the end of January, Jason Snell published his annual <a href=\"https://sixcolors.com/post/2019/01/apple-in-2018-the-six-colors-report-card/\">Six Colors Apple Report Card for 2018</a>. This year 55 voters (hand-selected by Snell) graded Apple in 11 areas. I was one of them, and thought it only fair to publish my grades and remarks here at Daring Fireball. Comments in [brackets] are additional commentary I wrote now, and were not included in what I submitted to Snell.</p>\n\n<h2>Mac: D</h2>\n\n<p>I’d say it’s been an OK year at best. On the MacBook front they had decent MacBook Pro updates and the third-gen butterfly keyboard seems to have fixed the reliability problems with the previous keyboards. But these keyboards are not great. A few people really like them, but most people agree they feel <em>worse</em> than the old keyboards. I may be biased as a writer <em>and</em> a keyboard aficionado, but it used to be the case that Apple’s notebook keyboards were widely hailed as the best in the world — that’s no longer the case, and I think that’s a problem.</p>\n\n<p>I like the new retina MacBook Air a lot, but it was overdue by at least a year.</p>\n\n<p>The new Mac Mini is great, but we still didn’t get a new Mac Pro and none of the iMacs were updated. That’s not good.</p>\n\n<p>Mojave seems fine overall but I personally don’t care about Dark Mode, and the new “Marzipan” apps — Home, News, Stocks, Voice Memos — range from “not great and a little weird” (Home) to “downright terrible” (the other three).</p>\n\n<p>[A &#8220;D&#8221; may seem harsh here, but the more I think about these MacBook keyboards the more unacceptable I find the whole situation. Apple makes a <em>great</em> keyboard today &#8212; the standalone Magic Keyboard 2 has a terrific feel and is completely reliable.</p>\n\n<p>I heard a story years ago about Steve Jobs after the release of the original iPad. Jobs had been on <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123196896984882901\">medical leave in 2009</a> and when he returned to Apple, he was focused almost entirely on the iPad. In 2010, after the iPad was introduced, he had a meeting scheduled with engineers on the MacBook team. The meeting was big picture &#8212; <em>What&#8217;s the future of the MacBook?</em>, that sort of thing. These engineers had prepared a ton of material to present to Jobs. Jobs comes into the meeting carrying an iPad. He goes to a then-shipping MacBook on a table and wakes it up. It takes a few seconds. He says something like &#8220;Look at how long this takes.&#8221; He puts it to sleep, he wakes it up. It takes a few moments each time. Then he puts the iPad on the table and hits the power button. On. Off. On. Off. Instantly. Jobs said something like &#8220;I want you to make this&#8221; &#8212; and he pointed to the MacBook &#8212; &#8220;like this&#8221; &#8212; and he pointed to the iPad. And then he walked out of the room and that was that. </p>\n\n<p>Is this story true? I don&#8217;t know. But it sounds true &#8212; and MacBooks do wake up a lot faster than they used to. I&#8217;d like someone at Apple to go to the MacBook team with a Magic Keyboard and do the same thing. &#8220;I want you to take this keyboard and put it in these MacBooks.&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The MacBook keyboards, lack of iMac updates, and still-missing Mac Pro would&#8217;ve led me to give Apple a &#8220;C&#8221; for the Mac. I took off a whole grade for how embarrassingly bad the &#8220;Marzipan&#8221; apps are.] </p>\n\n<h2>iPhone: A</h2>\n\n<p>On the hardware front, the iPhone XS and XS Max are great flagships, and months later I continue to be amazed by the quality and capabilities of their camera systems, both for stills and especially for video. There are some Android phones that are arguably as good as the iPhone for still photography but Apple is years ahead on video.</p>\n\n<p>The iPhone XR is way more XS-comparable than I expected. The compromises Apple chose — LCD instead of OLED, a single rear-facing camera, aluminum instead of stainless steel — aren’t noticeable by most people. And the XR gets <em>better</em> battery life — noticeably better. After spending a few weeks using a XR full-time, I honestly question whether its LCD isn’t better than the XS’s OLED for my needs.</p>\n\n<p>iOS 12 is one of my favorite iOS updates for iPhone in years. Apple promised back at WWDC that they were focusing on performance and they delivered. It’s faster and more reliable, and the new grouped notifications are a joy to use. iOS 12 on iPhone is Apple at its software best.</p>\n\n<h2>iPad: B</h2>\n\n<p>I really wish this were two categories, hardware and software. On the hardware front Apple had an &#8220;A&#8221; year. The new 9.7-inch iPad at a sub-$400 starting price is a terrific mass market tablet, now with Apple Pencil support. The new iPad Pros are, quite simply, the best portable computers ever made by anyone. They are astounding in every regard — display quality, performance (CPU and GPU), size and weight. They feel like artifacts from a few years in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Software-wise, I’d be tempted to rate this year for iPad as “N/A”. It wasn’t good, it wasn’t bad — it was nothing. Which, effectively, is bad, because I think the iPad needs an “iPadOS” overhaul. The iPad has always been great for simple use cases. “It’s just a big iPhone” is, for many people and many use cases, a compliment, not an insult. But the iPad needs to scale better for advanced use cases — without complicating simple use cases — and iOS 12 wasn’t an advance on that front in any meaningful way.</p>\n\n<h2>Apple Watch: B</h2>\n\n<p>I don’t think Apple gets enough credit for its expertise in miniaturization. They’ve long been the best company in the world at making ever-smaller ever-more-powerful tiny personal computers, and their lead seems to be growing, not shrinking. Apple Watch exemplifies that.</p>\n\n<p>My only beef with Series 4 hardware and WatchOS 5 is that there’s an aesthetic mismatch between new hardware and watch faces and old hardware and watch faces. The new WatchOS faces only look right on the new Series 4 watches, and the old faces only look truly right on the older watch hardware.</p>\n\n<h2>Apple TV: C</h2>\n\n<p>I don’t think Apple needed to come out with new Apple TV hardware this year, but they should have dropped the price on the existing hardware.</p>\n\n<h2>Services: B</h2>\n\n<p>iCloud Photos is now one of the best sync services I’ve ever used. It’s fast and reliable, and it handles data that I consider invaluable — my family’s photos and videos. iCloud overall has gotten very good. But the 5 GB free tier is just ridiculous at this point.</p>\n\n<h2>HomeKit: C</h2>\n\n<p>[No remarks.]</p>\n\n<h2>Hardware Reliability: B</h2>\n\n<p>[No remarks.]</p>\n\n<h2>Software Quality: C</h2>\n\n<p>[No remarks.]</p>\n\n<h2>Developer Relations: C</h2>\n\n<p>[No remarks. ]</p>\n\n<h2>Environmental/Social: B</h2>\n\n<p>[No remarks submitted, but I wish now that I&#8217;d made mention of <a href=\"https://www.macobserver.com/news/lisa-jackson-sustainable-iphones/\">Lisa Jackson&#8217;s remarks on stage at the September iPhone XS/XR introduction</a>. Given all the conspiracy theories about Apple and planned obsolescence, it was fascinating to see Jackson on stage touting the durability and longevity of iPhone hardware. Apple promised that iOS 12 would run faster than iOS 11 on older hardware and they made good on that promise. Apple is right to be proud of this, and it&#8217;s good for customers and good for the environment. And in the long run, good for Apple.]</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<h2>Retail: C</h2>\n\n<p>In between Snell&#8217;s release of the 2018 report card and my posting this piece, Apple has announced that <a href=\"https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2019/02/apple-names-deirdre-obrien-senior-vice-president-of-retail-and-people/\">Angela Ahrendts is leaving in April</a>. In the wake of this, there&#8217;s been a lot of commentary about the state of Apple&#8217;s retail stores, which, in turn, makes me think that &#8220;Retail&#8221; should be one of the categories on the Six Colors report card. If it were, I&#8217;d have given Apple a &#8220;C&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>The two best things Apple has done in retail during the Ahrendts era are opening architecturally amazing new flagship stores around the world, and the &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.apple.com/today/\">Today at Apple</a>&#8221; program in every store. But for me, personally, I don&#8217;t care about huge new flagship stores in Dubai or Paris, and I don&#8217;t partake in the &#8220;Today at Apple&#8221; classes. I care about two things: buying stuff and getting service at my local Apple Store here in Philadelphia.</p>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve disliked the experience of buying stuff at the Apple Store ever since they did away with queues for checking out. I just want to get in line, wait my turn, pay, and leave. Instead, the way to check out at an Apple Store is to wander around until you get the attention of an employee who has one of the handheld checkout iPod Touches. This can be maddening. My wife refuses to shop at an Apple Store for this reason. I know you can use  the Apple Store app to check yourself out, but I don&#8217;t like it. Part of the reason Apple&#8217;s stores are too crowded is that people are wandering around trying to pay for things.</p>\n\n<p>And getting technical support at Apple Stores is terrible now. In the old days you could just walk in with a broken or otherwise problematic device and get an appointment at the Genius Bar within the hour. Now, the Genius Bar is booked for days in advance &#8212; sometimes close to a week. In some ways that&#8217;s inevitable &#8212; Apple is way more popular now than it was pre-iPhone. But inevitable or not, the result is that getting support at an Apple Store now stinks. And frankly, the technical acumen of the Genius Bar staffers is now hit-or-miss.</p>\n\n<p>&#8220;Today at Apple&#8221; is nice, but the primary purposes of an Apple Store should be shopping and service &#8212; and I think both of those experiences should be a lot better.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

At the end of the episode, she mentioned that she was working on a piece about webcam security for her Personal Tech column at The Wall Street Journal. <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-i-learned-from-the-hacker-who-spied-on-me-11549559728\">That column dropped yesterday</a>, and I found it half enlightening, half maddening.</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>How secure are these tiny eyes into our private lives? The bad\nnews is, it was possible for Mr. Heid to get into my Windows 10\nlaptop’s webcam and, from there, my entire home network. He also\neventually cracked my MacBook Air. The good news is that both\noperating systems were initially able to thwart the hacker. It\ntook me performing some intentionally careless things for him to\n“succeed.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Key words there: <em>intentionally careless</em>.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how he got into her Windows 10 laptop &#8212; admittedly using only &#8220;off-the-shelf hacking tools&#8221;:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>When I opened the attached Word doc, Microsoft ’s built-in, free\nanti-virus software, Windows Defender, immediately flagged it.\nWhen I clicked the link to the “reel,” the file that began\ndownloading was identified as a virus and deleted. The system\nworked, but I wanted to see what would happen if I were someone\nwho didn’t have anti-virus turned on in the first place, or who\nturned it off because it got annoying.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s how the security expert got into her MacBook (again, using only &#8220;off-the-shelf hacking tools&#8221;):</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Hacking a 2015 MacBook Air running the latest MacOS version,\nMojave, also required a multistep process (and some missteps by\nthe “victim”). This time the malware was embedded in an .odt\ndocument, an open-source file format.</p>\n\n<p>To open it, I downloaded LibreOffice. The free version of the\npopular open-source office suite isn’t in the Mac App Store,\nhowever, so I had to disable the Mac security setting that\nprevents unverified developer software installation. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>Once I installed LibreOffice, I turned off its macro security\nsetting, per the hacker’s instructions. There are scenarios where\nyou might do this &#8212; say, for instance, because your company used\na specially designed inventory spreadsheet or sales form &#8212; but\nfor most people, it’s a bad idea. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>I did get a pop-up asking for camera access, and I clicked OK,\nlike we might do when we’re in a rush. Because Mr. Heid was only\nsnapping stills, the webcam LED only lit up for a second.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>So she had to download LibreOffice (weird), disable LibreOffice&#8217;s macro security (really weird), and then <em>still</em> had to grant explicit permission for LibreOffice to access the camera. If you open a document that prompts you for access to the camera, aren&#8217;t you expecting it to be able to access your camera?</p>\n\n<p>Stern&#8217;s advice to Mac users:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Installing those nagging security and OS updates are a must &#8212;\non your phone, laptop, router, thermostat, really anything\nthat connects to the internet. They include the latest\nattempts to patch the holes that hackers use to get in. Mac\nusers should install Malwarebytes or other malware-fighting\nsoftware &#8212; and don’t turn off any security features just\nbecause someone asks you to.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve long argued that third-party anti-malware software on the Mac causes more problems than it solves. If someone is willing to ignore the warning from MacOS that an app isn&#8217;t from a verified developer, and is willing to disable the security settings in that app at the behest of a social engineering hacker, why wouldn&#8217;t that same person be gullible enough to also disable their anti-malware software?</p>\n\n<p>Stern also claims she&#8217;s now using a physical stick-on camera cover. But why? In both cases &#8212; Mac and PC &#8212; the built-in system software did its job and issued clear warnings that she had to ignore for the attack to proceed. And even then &#8212; on both Mac and PC &#8212; the light next to the camera went on when it was in use.</p>\n\n<p>There&#8217;s nothing in Stern&#8217;s story that makes me worry in the least bit about the security of my Mac webcams, and I don&#8217;t see anything that should worry someone running Windows 10 with Windows Defender (Microsoft&#8217;s built-in security software). The path to compromising Stern&#8217;s cameras was like a test of your home security that starts with a request that you leave your door unlocked and turn off your alarm system.</p>\n\n<p>I have never understood the mass paranoia over laptop webcams &#8212; which have in-use indicator lights, which I&#8217;ve seen no evidence can be circumvented on Macs from the last decade &#8212; and the complete lack of similar paranoia over microphones, which cannot be blocked by a piece of tape and which have no in-use indicator lights. And I don&#8217;t see anyone taping over the cameras on their phones. This story is only going to feed that paranoia, because the takeaway is going to be &#8220;<em>The Wall Street Journal says you should cover up your webcam.</em>&#8221;</p>\n\n<hr />\n\n<p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/security/2013/12/perv-utopia-light-on-macbook-webcams-can-be-bypassed/\">Security researchers at Johns Hopkins released a paper in 2013</a> revealing that the indicator lights on Macs released prior to 2008 could be circumvented by software. <a href=\"\">I linked to this in 2016</a>, wondering if the same exploit was possible on more recent Macs. Here&#8217;s an answer I received from a former engineer at Apple who was intimately familiar with the software drivers for Mac webcams:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>The original cameras had the problem that the JHU researchers\ndetailed in the article that your linked to. Problem was that the\nfirmware was downloaded on every boot and there was no\nsecurity/encryption mechanism for verifying it. The part used was\nfairly common and the firmware was just in RAM (hence the loading\nafter a cold boot), as oppose to flashed.</p>\n\n<p>All cameras after that one were different: The hardware team\ntied the LED to a hardware signal from the sensor: If the (I\nbelieve) vertical sync was active, the LED would light up. There\nis NO firmware control to disable/enable the LED. The actual\nfirmware is indeed flashable, but the part is not a generic part\nand there are mechanisms in place to verify the image being\nflashed. [&#8230;]</p>\n\n<p>So, no, I don&#8217;t believe that malware could be installed to enable\nthe camera without lighting the LED. My concern would be a\nsituation where a frame is captured so the LED is lit only for a\nvery brief period of time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The still photo problem &#8212; where the light only turns on for the instant the image is being captured &#8212; is interesting. But I would wager real money that the camera indicator light cannot be circumvented by software on any Mac released this decade.</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/linked/2016/06/23/\">As I wrote back in 2016 about taping over your webcam</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>I think this is nonsense. Malware that can surreptitiously engage\nyour camera can do all sort of other nefarious things. If you\ncan’t trust your camera, you can’t trust your keyboard either.\nFollow best practices to avoid malware in the first place &#8212; don’t\ninstall Flash Player, and don’t install software from sketchy\nsources &#8212; and you’ll almost certainly be fine.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>The problem isn&#8217;t your camera, it&#8217;s malware. Don&#8217;t install any software from unknown or sketchy sources, keep your OS up to date<sup id=\"fnr1-2019-02-08\"><a href=\"#fn1-2019-02-08\">1</a></sup>, and you should be fine. And if you do have malware on your Mac, the webcam is likely the least of your problems.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2019-02-08\">\n<p>MacOS 10.14 Mojave, in particular, has made some significant improvements to identifying and disabling malware automatically. I got a fascinating email from a Genius Bar tech recently, who said that his time the last few years had been consumed more and more by Mac malware problems. Then Mojave shipped, and malware problems dropped noticeably, and when he does see a malware problem these days, it&#8217;s almost always on a Mac that isn&#8217;t running Mojave.&nbsp;<a href=\"#fnr1-2019-02-08\"  class=\"footnoteBackLink\"  title=\"Jump back to footnote 1 in the text.\">&#x21A9;&#xFE0E;</a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n</div>\n\n\n\n    "

It’s not guessing at a 2:1 compression ratio, like\nSalient’s AutoDoubler and DiskDoubler (now owned by Symantec) &#8212;\nyou actually see your total memory being twice your built-in\nmemory. Since RAM Doubler is an extension, there are no controls,\nno configuration. You just install it and it doubles the amount of\napplication RAM you have available.</p>\n\n<p>A number of people have expressed disbelief that such a feat is\npossible, saying that they’d avoid anything like RAM Doubler\nbecause it’s obviously doing strange things to memory, which isn’t\nsafe. [&#8230;]  >\nNeedless to say, since RAM Doubler has only been out for a few\ndays, we haven’t been testing for long, but I can honestly say\nthat neither of us have noticed anything out of the ordinary\nduring this time.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>This is <a href=\"https://tidbits.com/2019/01/24/25-years-ago-in-tidbits-ram-doubler-debuts/\">the start of a series</a> TidBITS is running, looking back at old articles from their archive.</p>\n\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t use RAM Doubler on my Mac LC, because it required a 68030 processor and the LC only had a 68020. But I used it on other Macs, and it really did work as advertised &#8212; it doubled your RAM in exchange for a negligible cost in performance. The most amazing thing, in hindsight, isn&#8217;t that compression and clever virtual memory techniques could double your memory &#8212; it&#8217;s that Mac OS was so open that something as low-level as RAM Doubler was even possible. Effectively, a Mac running RAM Doubler was running a fork of the OS &#8212; not just a subtle fork but a fork where the entire memory manager was written by a third party.</p>\n\n<p>In hindsight, the lack of protected memory and disk permissions in classic Mac OS are generally only looked back upon as severe deficiencies. And there certainly were deep problems with that architecture &#8212; one app or extension crashing often resulted in the entire machine going down. But that <em>anything goes</em> openness also resulted in tremendous opportunities for third-party software.</p>\n\n<p>From a low-level computer science operating systems perspective, the classic Mac OS was dangerously primitive. But from a high-level user interface perspective, it remains amazing. To install RAM Doubler &#8212; software that radically changed the way the OS worked &#8212; all you had to do was copy one file to the Extensions folder in your System folder. To uninstall, you just moved it out of that folder. That&#8217;s it. One file in one special folder and then restart the machine.</p>\n\n<p>Third-party extensions could be exasperating, yes, but they could also be amazing and just plain <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE7EWDKVM1Y\">fun</a> in ways that aren&#8217;t possible today.</p>\n\n\n\n    "

It currently has the headline &#8220;Apple Plans to Cut Back on Hiring Due to iPhone Sales Struggles&#8221;. The title of the web page (what you see in a browser tab, for example) is &#8220;Apple Cuts Back on Some Hiring After Selling Fewer iPhones&#8221;. And the URL slug for the article &#8212; usually a sign as to what the original headline was &#8212; is &#8220;apple-is-said-to-plan-some-hiring-reductions-amid-iphone-woes&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>These three headlines paint very different summaries of the story. Are they cutting back on hiring, or <em>planning to</em>? &#8220;Due to iPhone sales struggles&#8221; is a <em>lot</em> punchier than &#8220;after selling fewer iPhones&#8221; &#8212; it attributes cause rather than merely implying it. And &#8220;iPhone sales struggles&#8221; paints a grimmer picture than &#8220;selling fewer iPhones&#8221;.</p>\n\n<p>Did Bloomberg tweak the headline to arrive at &#8220;Apple Plans to Cut Back on Hiring Due to iPhone Sales Struggles&#8221; because that&#8217;s the most accurate summary of the story, or because it&#8217;s the most sensational?</p>\n\n<p>And what the heck is actually going on at Apple? Keep in mind that even with their earnings warning, Apple&#8217;s holiday quarter is going to be the second best quarter (both by revenue and profit) for any company in history, second only to Apple&#8217;s holiday quarter a year ago. The basic narrative of Gurman&#8217;s piece, especially when you start from the impression left by the headline, is that iPhone sales are so problematic that the company is going to hire fewer people this year than it had expected to. Like they&#8217;re in financial straits.</p>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s the bulk of Gurman&#8217;s report:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>Apple Inc. will cut back on hiring for some divisions after\nselling fewer iPhones than expected and missing its revenue\nforecast for the holiday quarter, according to people familiar\nwith the matter.</p>\n\n<p>Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive officer, made the disclosure to\nemployees earlier this month in a meeting the day after he penned\na letter to investors about the company’s recent struggles,\nparticularly in China. During the meeting, Cook was asked if the\ncompany would impose a hiring freeze in response. He said he\ndidn’t believe that was the solution. Instead, Cook said some\ndivisions would reduce hiring, according to the people, who asked\nnot to be identified discussing private matters.</p>\n\n<p>Cook said he is yet to fully determine which divisions would cut\nback on hiring, but said that key groups such as Apple’s\nartificial intelligence team would continue to add new employees\nat a strong pace. He also emphasized that a division’s importance\nto Apple’s future isn’t measured by hiring rates.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>On the surface, this narrative doesn&#8217;t really make any sense. A $7 billion earnings miss is a big deal, yes, but we&#8217;re talking about $84 billion in revenue instead of $91 billion. Whatever hiring plans Apple had in place, it&#8217;s not like they needed that money to make the hires. There aren&#8217;t enough potential Apple employees alive on the planet for it to make sense that Apple had hiring plans that required Apple to hit its revenue guidance for last quarter.</p>\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take it as a given that Gurman is correct that Tim Cook has told employees that Apple is making plans to slow hiring in some divisions. Not that they <em>are</em> slowing hiring, but that they are drawing contingency plans to do so. But why? What&#8217;s the contingency? Bloomberg would have us believe it&#8217;s in response to one disappointing quarter. Or perhaps rather than just one bad quarter, a better description of the contingency in Bloomberg&#8217;s narrative is the fear that last quarter was only the start, and iPhone sales will continue decelerating precipitously.</p>\n\n<p>That would strike me as a panicked overreaction. Tim Cook is not a panicky overreactor. And Apple went through a similar sales cycle with the iPhone 6S in 2015-16 &#8212; where the iPhone was still wildly popular but sales dropped a click or two from the previous model year. There was no talk of hiring slowdowns then.</p>\n\n<p>Making plans for reduced hiring would indicate that Tim Cook is spooked, though. I think it makes a lot more sense that what he&#8217;s spooked by is not the drop in iPhone sales in China. Every company that sells anything in China is <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/samsung-misses-profit-estimates-chip-233624233.html\">prepping Wall Street for bad quarterly numbers</a>.</p>\n\n<p>I think what has Cook spooked is not the drop in iPhone sales, but the fact that the iPhone sales drop in China might be a <em>symptom</em> of a bigger problem. An effect, not the cause. Apple has gotten crazily good at predicting everything about their financials. It&#8217;s almost freaky how accurate they&#8217;ve been for years. But they got something <em>very</em> wrong last quarter. Again, it was a slight year-over-year decline, but it was the second-best quarter in history. iPhone sales were disappointing compared to expectations, but weren&#8217;t <em>bad</em> in the abstract. What was bad was Apple&#8217;s guidance. A $7 billion miss is bad, but Apple not foreseeing a $7 billion miss is a red flag. I think they&#8217;re evaluating deeper plans <em>just in case</em> it was more than just one thing in one quarter. No one wants to say the word, but I think it&#8217;s what has Cook spooked.</p>\n\n<p>Recession.</p>\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t trust the numbers from China&#8217;s government, so it&#8217;s all a bit anecdotal. But it&#8217;s not just Apple, and not just one industry warning about a bad quarter in China. I&#8217;ve heard from a few people who travel to China regularly, and several have told me that inside China, everyone agrees the country is in a recession. The only question is how bad &#8212; is this a brief cold, or a bad case of the flu? </p>\n\n<p>Cook doesn&#8217;t seem like a head-in-the-sand, I&#8217;m-sure-everything-will-be-fine optimist. It would be better if the problem were just something to do with the appeal of 2018&#8217;s iPhone lineup. That would be entirely within Apple&#8217;s control to fix &#8212; albeit over the course of years, given the two-year (or longer) lead time for new iPhones. A recession &#8212; whether limited to China, or worse, starting in China but spreading worldwide &#8212; is out of Apple&#8217;s control. And it&#8217;s not like the U.S. economy is currently looking rock solid or under steady-handed leadership.</p>\n\n<p>If Tim Cook suspects that a recession is a credible possibility, he&#8217;d want plans in place to turn the company on a dime to adjust.</p>\n\n<div class=\"footnotes\">\n<hr />\n<ol>\n<li id=\"fn1-2019-01-17\">\n<p>Bloomberg, of course, is the publication that published &#8220;<a href=\"https://daringfireball.net/2018/10/bloomberg_the_big_hack\">The Big Hack</a>&#8221; in October &#8212; a sensational story alleging that data centers of Apple, Amazon, and dozens of other companies were compromised by China&#8217;s intelligence services.
